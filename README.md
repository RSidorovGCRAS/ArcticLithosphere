# ArcticLithosphere
A set of geophysical fields for modelling of the lithosphere structure and dynamics in the Russian Arctic zone
This is a set of various geological and geophysical data for the eastern part of the Russian Arctic zone. This hard-accessible territory has a complex geological structure, which is poorly studied by direct geophysical methods. Therefore, these data can be used in an integrative analysis for different purposes. First of all, these are the gravity field, heat flow, and various tomographic models. For the gravity field several reductions were calculated, which are more appropriate for study of the Earth interiors than the initial free air anomalies. Specifically, these are the Bouguer, isostatic and decompensative gravity anomalies. A new surface heat flow model is based on a joint inversion of multiple geophysical data constrained by the observations from the catalog of the International Heat Flow Commission. Available seismic models have been analyzed to select the best one for further investigations. Furthermore, we provide new models for the sedimentary cover and for the Moho depth, which are significantly improved compared to the existing ones. In summary, this data-base provides a basis for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the region.
